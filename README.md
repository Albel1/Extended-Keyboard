# Extended-Keyboard
A light-weight productivity tool for user-defined macros (inspired by LaTeX commands, but for Unicode macros to be used globally) using the low-level C libraries provided by the OS to listen and send keystrokes, and the QT framework for the GUI. Designed to be compatible over a variety of operating systems.
